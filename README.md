The data we have are nfcapd dump files, with filenames like nfcapd.YYYYMMDDHHMM. We use nfdump to convert these files into csv's.

Still not finding a clue about which netflow version these files are using although I manually read the bytes of the file head...But anyway, move on to process nfcapd dumps into csv's

nfTocsv.py converts nfcapd dump files to csv files.

Next step: import these csv files into a database. 
- import a single csv file into the database
- import a group of csv's into the database
 - crosscheck number of records match: 
   - 23,460,191 from direct counting csv files
   - 23,460,191 from counting the database entries

csv2sqlite.py imports csv files into a database.

General findings about nfdumped csv files:
- 48 fields
  - ts, te, td: time start (first packet seen of this flow), time end(last packet seen of this flow), time duration
  - sa, da, sp, dp, pr: source/destination address, source/destination port, protocol
  - flg: ------, 6 bits, TCP flags
  - fwd: forwarding status
  - stos, dtos: src/des TOS
  - ipkt, ibyt, opkt, obyt: incoming packets/bytes, outgoing packets/bytes
  - in, out: input/output interface SNMP number
  - sas, das: source/destination BGP AS
  - smk, dmk: source/destination mask
  - dir: direction, 0: ingress flow, 1: egress flow
  - nh, nhb: nexthop IP address, bgp next hop IP
  - svln, dvln: src/dst vlan label
  - ismc, odmc, idmc, osmc: input src, output dst, input dst, output src MAC
  - mpls1-10: MPLS label 1-10
  - cl, sl, al: client/server/application latency
  - ra, eng, exid: router IP, router engine type/id, exporter sysid
  - tr: time the flow was received by the controller


Starting with netflow traces collected from router lbl-mr2. This dataset contains sampled flows from 01/31/2016 - 02/13/2016.
- other than day 02/11, which has 278 dump files, each day has 288 files; 288 = 24*60/5
- on day 02/11, files are missing between 10:15 and 11:10 (nfcapd.201602111110.csv is next to nfcapd.201602111015.csv)

Initial findings about this data:
- The nfcapd dump files are divided into 5min bins, based on the 'tr time': time the flow was received by the controller
   - Ex. dump file with timestamp 2016/01/31 19:15, includes netflow records received between 19:15 and 19:20
   - We could calculate the deviation of the exact time the flow occurs and the observed time window.
- Non-informative fields:
  - fwd: forwarding status; The values under 'fwd' are ALL 0, meaning unknown [(1)].
  - opkt/obyt: output packets, bytes; The values under 'opkt/obyt' are ALL 0.
  - dtos: the value is 0 for the whole dataset
  - dir: flow direction: 0 - ingress flow, 1 - egress flow [(1)]; The values under 'dir' are ALL 0. 
  - nhb: the value is 0.0.0.0 for the whole dataset
  - svln/dvln: 0/0 for the whole dataset
  - ismc/odmc/idmc/osmc: the value is 00:00:00:00:00:00 for the whole dataset
  - mpls1-10: 0-0-0 for the whole dataset
  - cl/sl/al: client/server/application latency; The values under 'cl/sl/al' are ALL 0.
  - ra, eng, exid: only one value is listed under these fields for the whole dataset.

Next step: plot entropy timeseries values as shown in this [paper](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/papers/imcfp04-nychis.pdf).
- based on sa(source address), da(destination address), sp(source port), dp(destination port), and ipkt/ibyt, and tr
- crosscheck number:
   - database
   - direct using csv files
