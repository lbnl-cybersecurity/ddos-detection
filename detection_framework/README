A modular detection tool for monitoring network logs.  Currently set for monitoring nfcapd files.  Given an nfcapd directory, this tool will continuously check for newly added log files and apply each analytics module in a separate thread.  For example, one thread can calculate the entropy scores for each observed flow, while another thread monitors the number of DNS responses. 

Usage: detection_main.py -i <netflow directory> -o <log name>

Main module: detection_main.py
In detection_main.py, set the number of tests and start each thread.  

detection_tests.py contains common functions and the thread functions.  Any detection test thread must have the following format:

To add a new test, do the following:
1.  Define the detection test as a class.
2.  In the class, create a function called run_test which takes an nfdump file as input.  The start_test() function in detection_tests.py calls this.
3.  Then you can add it to the config.ini file by adding "test_name = module_name.class_name"
4.  The tester class also needs a variable called "log_entry".  When tester.log_entry is not empty, the entry is recorded to the log by the function feeding nfdump files to the tester. 
5.  Variables such as test thresholds can be modified using config.ini
